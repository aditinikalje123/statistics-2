        "THEORY QUESTIONS\n",
        "\n",
        "1)What is a random variable in probability theory\n",
        "Ans:-A random variable is a variable whose value is determined by the outcome of a random process.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2)What are the types of random variables\n",
        "Ans:-discrete random variable and continous random variable\n",
        "\n",
        "3) What is the difference between discrete and continuous distributions\n",
        "Ans:-The difference between discrete(countable) and continuous(uncountable) distributions lies in the type of values their random variables can take and how probabilities are assigned.\n",
        "\n",
        "4)What are probability distribution functions (PDF)\n",
        "Ans:-In probability theory, a Probability Distribution Function (PDF) refers to a function that describes the likelihood of a random variable taking on a particular value or range of values.\n",
        "\n",
        "5)How do cumulative distribution functions (CDF) differ from probability distribution functions (PDF)\n",
        "Ans:-A Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) gives the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a certain value, while a Probability Distribution Function (PDF) (for continuous variables) or Probability Mass Function (PMF) (for discrete variables) describes the likelihood of specific values. The PDF shows how dense the probabilities are around a value, but the CDF accumulates those probabilities up to a point. For example, while a PDF tells you how likely a value is, the CDF tells you how likely it is to get a value up to that point. CDFs always increase from 0 to 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "6) What is a discrete uniform distribution\n",
        "Ans:-A discrete uniform distribution is a probability distribution where all outcomes in a finite set are equally likely\n",
        "\n",
        "7)What are the key properties of a Bernoulli distribution\n",
        "Ans:-takes two possible outcomes possiblely success and failure.\n",
        "\n",
        "8)What is the binomial distribution, and how is it used in probability\n",
        "Ans:-The binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, where each trial has only two possible outcomes: success or failure.\n",
        "\n",
        "9) What is the Poisson distribution and where is it applied\n",
        "Ans:-The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of times an event occurs in a fixed interval of time or space, given a constant average rate and independence between events.\n",
        "\n",
        "10)What is a continuous uniform distribution\n",
        "Ans:-A continuous uniform distribution is a probability distribution where a continuous random variable takes values equally likely within a specific interval\n",

        "[a,b]\n",
        "\n",
        "11)What are the characteristics of a normal distribution\n",
        "Ans:-bell shaped, symmetric , mean/median/mode are equal ,68-95-99.7\n",
        "\n",
        "12)What is the standard normal distribution, and why is it important\n",
        "Ans:-The standard normal distribution is a special case of the normal distribution with a mean (\n",
        "ùúá\n",
        "Œº) of 0 and a standard deviation (\n",
        "ùúé\n",
        "œÉ) of 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "13)What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and why is it critical in statistics\n",
        "Ans:-When you take a sufficiently large number of independent, random samples from any population (regardless of its distribution), the distribution of the sample means will approximate a normal distribution ‚Äî with mean equal to the population mean and variance equal to the population variance divided by the sample size.\n",
        "\n",
        "14) How does the Central Limit Theorem relate to the normal distribution\n",
        "Ans:-The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) explains why the normal distribution appears so often in statistics: it states that the distribution of the sample means of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables will be approximately normal, regardless of the original population‚Äôs distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "15)What is the application of Z statistics in hypothesis testing\n",
        "Ans:-Z-statistics (or Z-tests) are widely used in hypothesis testing when you want to determine whether a sample mean significantly differs from a known population mean, especially when the population standard deviation is known or the sample size is large.\n",
        "\n",
        "16)How do you calculate a Z-score, and what does it represent\n",
        "Ans:-The Z-score of a value\n",
        "The Z-score tells you how many standard deviations a value\n",
        "ùë•\n",
        "x is above or below the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "A positive Z-score means\n",
        "ùë•\n",
        "x is above the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "A negative Z-score means\n",
        "ùë•\n",
        "x is below the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "A Z-score of 0 means the value is exactly at the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "17)What are point estimates and interval estimates in statistics\n",
        "Ans:-A point estimate is a single value calculated from sample data that serves as the best guess or estimate of an unknown population parameter (like the mean or proportion).\n",
        "An interval estimate provides a range of values within which the population parameter is likely to lie, along with a confidence level.\n",
        "\n",
        "18)What is the significance of confidence intervals in statistical analysis\n",
        "Ans:-Confidence intervals (CIs) are crucial in statistics because they provide a range of plausible values for an unknown population parameter, rather than just a single point estimate. This helps quantify the uncertainty inherent in sampling.\n",
        "\n",
        "19)What is the relationship between a Z-score and a confidence interval\n",
        "Ans:-The Z-score and confidence interval (CI) are closely connected because the Z-score helps determine the width of the confidence interval when estimating a population parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "20)How are Z-scores used to compare different distributions\n",
        "Ans:-Z-scores allow you to standardize values from different distributions so you can compare them on the same scale, even if the original data have different means and standard deviations.\n",
        "\n",
        "21)What are the assumptions for applying the Central Limit Theorem\n",
        "Ans:-Independence:\n",
        "The sampled observations must be independent of each other. This is usually ensured by random sampling or random assignment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sample Size:\n",
        "The sample size\n",
        "ùëõ\n",
        "n should be sufficiently large. While there‚Äôs no strict cutoff,\n",
        "ùëõ\n",
        "‚â•\n",
        "30\n",
        "n‚â•30 is a common rule of thumb for many distributions. For populations already close to normal, smaller samples may suffice.\n",
        "\n",
        "Identically Distributed:\n",
        "The samples are drawn from the same population with the same distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finite Variance:\n",
        "The population must have a finite variance (i.e., variability isn‚Äôt infinite).\n",
        "\n",
        "22) What is the concept of expected value in a probability distribution\n",
        "Ans:-The expected value of a probability distribution is essentially the long-run average or mean value you would expect if you repeated an experiment many times.\n",
        "\n",
        "23)How does a probability distribution relate to the expected outcome of a random variable\n",
        "Ans:-A probability distribution describes all possible outcomes of a random variable and the probabilities associated with each outcome. The expected outcome (or expected value) is a summary measure derived from that distribution.\n",
